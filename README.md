Encryption for CAN Buses with Dynamic ID mirroring

Dynamic ID mirroring reduces the delays in CAN communication caused due to increased payload size because of data encryption.
Implementation based on: M. Zhang and A. Masrur, "Improving Timing Behavior on Encrypted CAN Buses," 2019 IEEE 25th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA), Hangzhou, China, 2019, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/RTCSA.2019.8864567.
